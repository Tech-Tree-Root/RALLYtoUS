				<h2>
					Introduction and Definitions
				</h2>
				<p>
					RALLY is the mission-driven initiative that brought together developers, designers, creatives, and entrepreneurs to create extremely efficient responses in our fight against the unexpected and world-changing challenges imposed by coronavirus. This program was sponsored and initiated by Tech Tree Root, the national hackathon organization of the United States.

				<p>
					In this Agreement, “Event” refers to the RALLY hackathon and other events organized by a RALLY entity you apply to participate in or otherwise register to.
				</p>
				<p>
					You agree to be bound by these Terms by using the Website and/or applying to participate in or otherwise register to an Event. For avoidance of doubt, a person that has been accepted to or otherwise registered to the Event is considered having participated in the Event.
				</p>
				<p>
					These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and us.
				<p>
					These Terms may be modified by us from time to time. It is your responsibility to periodically check these Terms for
					changes. Continued participation in any of our Events and/or continued use of the Website following the modifications will imply that you accept and agree to the changes. Additionally, you may be reading these terms on a service provided by a third party. In this, case this version may be outdated, but the latest version can always be found on the Website.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Application to the Event

				</p>
				<p>
					If you register or apply as an entity or on behalf of a team, you confirm that such entity and each person in the team accepts these Terms and that you have the right to represent such entity and team for the purposes of these Terms.

					We collect and process information, including personal information in relation to your registrations or applications on the Website, application to or participation in any of our Events, such as your contact details, other identification data, CV, and information relating to your submissions, including your projects. To the extent we are considered as the data controller for such personal information pursuant to the applicable laws, we will inform data subjects regarding the processing practices in our Privacy Policy, as well as process such personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy in force from time to time. Our Privacy Policy can be found on our Website (<a href="../privacy/">https://rallyto.us/privacy</a>).
